## Project Overview
A movie website that pulls from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/),
i.e. a movie database, which displays movie covers for the user to select
and engage in a quiz, with questions based on the information provided by
the API. A score/rating will be given to the user based on how many
questions they got correctly about the selected movie's information, i.e.
how much the "know" the movie.
## Purpose/Goals
To demonstrate class **adv-ci-04-18-22**'s ability to construct a
full-stack software project in a group setting using Agile methodology.
## Obstables
- Properly retrieving the *correct* data for a particular movie the user
selected.
- Format of the questions and how they would relevantly fit to the data
provided from the API (parser?)
- Making sure React and our internal API in Spring communicate with each
other effectively
